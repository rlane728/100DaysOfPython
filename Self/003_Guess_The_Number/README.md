### Guess The Number

ChatGPT and I were discussing some beginner level-10 coding challenges.  This one is still a bit too easy, but I'll give it a go anyways just to relax...

I understand your point. Let's make it a bit more challenging with a different coding challenge:

**Challenge: Guess the Number**

Write a Python program where the computer selects a random number between a specified range, and the user has to guess that number. Here's what you need to do:

1. The program should generate a random number between a specified minimum and maximum range.
2. The user is given a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.
3. After each guess, the program should provide feedback to the user, telling them if their guess was too high or too low.
4. If the user guesses the correct number within the allowed attempts, the program should congratulate them and display the number of attempts it took.
5. If the user exhausts all attempts without guessing the correct number, the program should reveal the correct number and inform the user that they lost.

This challenge involves conditional statements, loops, random number generation, and user input. It should provide a more engaging task for you. Give it a try, and let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!
