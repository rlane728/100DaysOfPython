### Password Strength Checker

I asked chatGPT for a quick challenege based on what I've learned thus far

This Python program checks the strength of a password based on specific criteria. It prompts the user to enter a password and evaluates whether the password meets the following requirements:

- At least 8 characters long.
- Contains both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Contains at least one digit (0-9).

### What I learned
1. Wrote my first python program completely from scratch
2. Expanded my understanding of python string functions, e.g. string.isupper()
3. Learned the any() function and recalled the len() function
4. First time I've used bools

### Usage
1. Run the program by executing the Python script.
