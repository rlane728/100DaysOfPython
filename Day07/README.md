### Day07: Project Hangman

My_Hangman.py

This is a full-day exercise building a hangman program.
We should be able to incorporate everything we've learned
thus far...
- FOR and WHILE loops
- Lists
- Strings
- Ranges
- Modules
- etc...

Most (if not all) notes on this day are in the code sections themselves,
and instead of carrying my code forward through each section, I use the instructor's code as my base.
